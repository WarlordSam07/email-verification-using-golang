Simple tool to check if the email domain name exists.

Hello World! 
This is a simple tool to check validity of emails. 
It checks whether the entered domain name has any Mail Exchanger (MX) Records, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Records and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Records. This would help in confirming the vaidity of the email domains.
